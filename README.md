Ctrl+Z starts duping slowly. This is safer for duping single items, or during lag.


Ctrl+Shift+Z starts duping quickly. This works best with InventoryTweaks and at least 2 of the same item. The idea is that while the first is waiting to be picked up, the second can be placed, saving time in increasing dupe rates.


Rarely, the item frame will break. On the fast setting, this can actually delete the item instead of duping it if you are unlucky! This usally happens due to lag. Make sure you have a few backups made with the slow method before using the fast method.
